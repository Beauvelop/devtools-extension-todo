A TODO Extension for the Chrome (and Opera) DevTools.

# Concept

We all use some sort of TODO application or something to manage tasks.
This DevTools extension puts the TODO list right where we spend a lot of time every day, the Browser DevTools.

It offers a general TODO list, plus something unique in a TODO list:
- you have a todo list for the domain you're on now
- you have a todo list for the page you're on now

This means that when you're building a site, you have all the todos that matter to web development right in the DevTools,
and the interface only shows the TODOs that you need to act on right now.

# Usage

From `chrome ? chrome://extensions : opera://extensions` click `Developer Mode` and `Load Unpacked Extension`.
Install and open the DevTools, you'll find a `TODO` panel.

# Future

- Will see how to improve the TODO visualization to make easier findind TODOs without having to load the web pages
- Port to Firefox / IE / Safari )
- Will add some sort of cross-browser / team syncronization (Parse / Firebase)
